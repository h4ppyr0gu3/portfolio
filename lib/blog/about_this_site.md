# About this site

## Astro
[Astro](https://astro.build) means that I can try any javascript framework and have somewhere to put it, this is the key reason i decided to go with it
So far I have used 3 seperate technologies, Namely: 
- SolidJS -> for the homepage
- Vue -> for the TIL page
- Svelte -> for the blog page
These are some of the latest technologies in the frontend world and I am excited to see what they can do

## Tailwind
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) Tailwind is very extensible and has great convenience features such as dark mode, it is also well supported by major frameworks and that means that no matter what framework I use, I will be able to get a consistent UI

## Ruby
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) is my default language and so i had to use it somewhere, so to make it worth my while i write blogs in pure mark down and have scripts to create and alter the .astro files by adding all the metadata etc... I also want to have syntax highlighting without too much difficulty so using a ruby script I can use the gitlab API to convert markdown into HTML which i can compliment with custom CSS so that i get the look that I want.

## AI
AI is the new big thing and so using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) i can generate a short excerpt as well as a couple of key words which can help for a simple search that i have implemented with fuseJS on the frontend, which is using a json object as a database

## Where to find it
This site is hosted on [render.com](https://render.com) and is also open source so can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/h4ppyr0gu3/portfolio)
It is a very simple site but allows me to play around with frontend technologies, as a backend developer it allows me to learn more about frontend and also the frontend technologies that are being used currently
